This project is a demo that showcases a voice chat bot to schedule appointments.


## How to demo the project

Visit the site at [Drill and Demo](https://drilldemo.vercel.app).

- This is a demo site that is meanth to look like a mock drilling and demolition company.
- The voice chat is embedded in the site and allows you to schedule appointments.
- The chatbot is powered by Sindarin. The hardcoded schedule is stored on Sindarin. 
- You as the user can chat with the chatbot and it will schedule appointments on your behalf. When you schedule a appointment, you will get a confirmation text to your phone number with the summary of the appointment. We are using a simple TextBelt API to send texts.
